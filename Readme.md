Era of Rulers is a strategy game based on the game 'Reigns', where you have to take decisions as ruler of the kingdom. The players aim is to survive as many years as possible without being murdered/deposed.
Developed using package SWING and mvc-structure.
Developed for educational purposes (This was my first "big project" in Java).

`This is the game Menu with 4 options (Play, Instructions, Shop and Settings).`<br><br>

```

This is the game itself.
1. At the center you can see a situation ("Our capital smells like garbage half a year. Let's build a sewer system.")
2. On the left you can see 3 different status relationships (bourgeoisie, military and commoners).
3. On the right you can see 2 possible decisions, in this case "Yes" or "No". As the mouse is hovering "Yes", you can see which relationships will be affected by making this decison (the dot on the right of the status rectangle).

```
Game Over
- As you can see the relationship with the commoners reached "0", therefore is the game over.
- Message: "Executed - The people were left in misery and therefore started a revolution."
- This player managed to survive 2.5 years in power (Top Left).
